This is a very simple script for creating autochanging
wallpapers using a XML file.

The script has a GUI that is used to select the wallpapers that
we want to be part of the "slideshow". The user can also change
the duration of the current wallpaper or change the transition
time between wallpapers.

The result is a xml file that we can use as wallpaper.

HOW TO USE IT
-------------

1) Run the script

2) Set the wallpaper
System > Appearance > Wallpaper > Add and then choose the output.xml file
